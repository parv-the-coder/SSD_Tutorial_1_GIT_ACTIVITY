# Software Systems Development (SSD) — Lab Activity 1

**Language:** C++

## Description
This repository contains the solution for **Lab Activity 1: Introduction to Git**  
from the Software Systems Development course.

The program calculates the distance between two points in a 2D plane  
using the **Euclidean distance formula**, with an experimental branch  
for **Manhattan distance**.

## Files
- `point.h` — Defines the `Point` structure.
- `distance.cpp` — Implements the distance calculation.
- `README.md` — Project information.
- `subtask*.txt` — Output files for Git operations.
